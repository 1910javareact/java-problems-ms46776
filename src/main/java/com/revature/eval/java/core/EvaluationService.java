	 * very weak cipher because it only has one possible key, and it is a simple
	 * monoalphabetic substitution cipher. However, this may not have been an issue
	 * in the cipher's time.
	 * 
	 * Ciphertext is written out in groups of fixed length, the traditional group
	 * size being 5 letters, and punctuation is excluded. This is to make it harder
	 * to guess things based on word boundaries.
